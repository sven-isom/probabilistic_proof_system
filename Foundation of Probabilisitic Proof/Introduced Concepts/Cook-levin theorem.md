## 1 Cook-Levin Theorem

The **Cook-Levin theorem** states that:

> The Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) is **NP-complete**.

More precisely:

- Every problem in the complexity class NP can be reduced in polynomial time to an instance of SAT.
- Thus, SAT is as hard as any problem in NP.
- This was the first problem proven to be NP-complete, establishing the foundation of NP-completeness theory.

In other words, the theorem shows that SAT is a universal problem for NP, and solving SAT efficiently would imply efficient solutions for all problems in NP.
