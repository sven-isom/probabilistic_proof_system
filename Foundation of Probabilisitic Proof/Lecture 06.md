## 1 Questions

### 1.1 Q1
#question 
Why should we reduce small language to some instacne of hard language, some sort of Tiny [[TQBF]].

In the setting of _Foundations of Probabilistic Proofs in Computer Science_, the reason for **reducing a “small” language to a fixed “hard” language** (like a tiny instance of TQBF) is essentially the same as in classical complexity theory:

1. **Purpose of Reduction**  
    A reduction lets you show that _if_ you can solve the “hard” language efficiently, you can also solve the “small” language efficiently.
    
    - Here, the “small” language might be something specific you actually care about.
        
    - The “hard” language (e.g., a fixed-sized variant of TQBF) is chosen because it is _complete_ for a large complexity class and has a clean, canonical form for which we can build proof systems.
        
2. **Why Not Directly Build a Proof for the Small Language?**  
    Sometimes the probabilistic proof protocol is easiest to design for a canonical, syntactically simple language (like _TQBF formulas of a particular size_).
    
    - For example, arithmetization (turning Boolean formulas into polynomials) is conceptually straightforward for TQBF, but might be messy for an arbitrary “small” language.
        
    - By reducing the “small” language to the “hard” language, you only need to design the protocol _once_ for the hard language.
        
3. **Tiny TQBF as a “core instance”**  
    The “tiny” form isn’t actually _easier_ computationally—it’s still complete for the target complexity class, just restricted in a syntactic way that makes the interactive proof machinery run smoothly.
    
    - In the PCP/IP constructions, you often pick a form where the verifier can check things with minimal overhead (e.g., a 3-CNF QBF of fixed variable counts per block).
        
    - These “tiny” instances are the canonical playground for the proof protocol—everything else gets funneled into them via a reduction.
        
4. **Analogy with NP and 3-SAT**  
    In NP theory, we reduce every NP problem to 3-SAT not because 3-SAT is “easier,” but because it’s a standard, well-structured representative where we can design algorithms/protocols more cleanly.
    
    - The probabilistic proof analogue is: reduce to a “Tiny TQBF” (or another canonical complete problem for PSPACE or the relevant class), then design the verifier for that.
        
5. **Practical Payoff**
    
    - **Uniformity:** One verifier works for all languages in the class.
        
    - **Simpler correctness/soundness proofs:** The protocol’s analysis is done once for the hard language; reductions preserve correctness/soundness up to a controllable blow-up in parameters.
        
    - **Efficiency:** The verifier only needs to know how to check the canonical instance type; the prover handles the reduction from the original problem.
        

If you want, I can give you a concrete example showing how a _small_ language (say, a restricted SAT variant) is reduced to a **Tiny TQBF** instance so that the interactive proof protocol only needs to be implemented for that one case.

Do you want me to give that example in the style used in **IP = PSPACE** proofs?


### 1.2 Q2

in the lecture 06, the lecture wants to show that honest prove is in a bad condition by saying that one honest prover can now run in big Omega (2^n). My question is, does the time complexity for prover here mean that even the prover is honest(like he knew the right assignment to some kind of circuit, he still need a lot of time to generate the proof?

Yes — in that part of lecture 06, _time complexity for the prover_ really is about the **actual work the prover must do during the interactive proof**, even if the prover is honest and already “knows” a satisfying assignment or the correct answer.


Why this happens

In the IP=PSPACE\text{IP} = \text{PSPACE} style protocols (like Shamir 1992):

1. The _prover’s job_ is not just to hand over a witness, but to:
    
    - Follow the **arithmetization** of the QBF or circuit computation,
        
    - Send the verifier evaluations of certain polynomials at random points,
        
    - Do this **recursively** for smaller and smaller subformulas.
        
2. For a general PSPACE problem (like a big QBF), the underlying truth table or polynomial can have **size exponential in nn**, even if the formula itself has polynomial length.  
    The honest prover has to compute correct coefficients, sums, and products over all branches — which may require enumerating or simulating an exponential number of possibilities.
    
3. This is why in Shamir’s protocol the **verifier** runs in polynomial time and space, but the **honest prover** may run in Ω(2n)\Omega(2^n) time in the worst case.
    
    - Even knowing “the right answer” doesn’t help much, because the proof demands _structural information_ about the whole computation tree, not just a single accepting branch.
        


Intuition with your “circuit” example

Suppose the language is “Does this Boolean circuit accept all 2n2^n inputs?”

- If the prover only knew one accepting assignment, that’s useless — the statement requires checking _all inputs_.
    
- To generate the messages required by the protocol, the prover effectively has to compute results of subcircuits for **many** inputs at once, which can be exponential work.
    

✅ **So yes:** even an _honest_ prover, with full knowledge of the truth of the statement, can still require exponential time to produce all the pieces of an interactive proof for a PSPACE-complete problem.  
This is a core difference between NP-style proofs (short witness, easy to check) and general IP proofs (possibly huge implicit witnesses, expensive for the prover to generate).


If you want, I can show you **exactly where in Shamir’s 1992 paper** this exponential work for the prover comes from in the IP=PSPACE\text{IP}=\text{PSPACE} construction. That section makes it concrete.
