## 1 What is it
Independent uniform random variables are a set of random variables where each variable follows:
- a uniform distribution, and 
- knowing the value of one variable doesn't provide any information about the values of the others. 

In simpler terms, they are random numbers, all drawn from the same range, but each value is chosen independently of the others. 

Here's a more detailed explanation:
### 1.1 Uniform Distribution

- A uniform distribution means that every value within a specific range (e.g., between 0 and 1) has an equal probability of being chosen.
- For example, a random number generator that produces values between 0 and 1 with equal probability is an example of a uniform random variable. 

### 1.2 Independence

- When random variables are **independent**, knowing the value of one variable doesn't change the probabilities associated with the other variables.
- In the context of uniform distributions, this means that if you have multiple independent uniform random variables, knowing the value of one doesn't tell you anything about the likely values of the others.
