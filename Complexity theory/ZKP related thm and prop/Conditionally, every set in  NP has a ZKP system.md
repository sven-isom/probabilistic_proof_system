## 1 Notes

No, it is **not true** that every set in NP has a Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) system (under standard assumptions and without additional setup).

### 1.1 Explanation

- **Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP):**  
  A ZKP system for a language $L$ allows a prover to convince a verifier that $x \in L$ without revealing any additional information beyond the validity of the statement.

- **NP and ZKP:**  
  Not every language in NP is known to have a (stand-alone, unconditional) zero-knowledge proof system.

#### 1.1.1 What is known:

- **NP-complete problems** (like SAT) do have zero-knowledge proof systems, **if one-way functions exist** (a standard cryptographic assumption).
- **If one-way functions exist**, then **every language in NP has a zero-knowledge proof system** (see Goldreich, Micali, Wigderson, 1991).
- **Unconditionally** (without any cryptographic assumptions), only a subset of NP (e.g., languages in BPP) are known to have zero-knowledge proofs.

#### 1.1.2 Summary Table

| Class         | ZKP System Exists?                  |
|---------------|-------------------------------------|
| NP-complete   | Yes, if one-way functions exist     |
| All NP        | Yes, if one-way functions exist     |
| All NP        | No, unconditionally                 |

### 1.2 Conclusion

**Only under certain cryptographic assumptions (like the existence of one-way functions) does every set in NP have a ZKP system.**  
Unconditionally, this is not known to be true.
