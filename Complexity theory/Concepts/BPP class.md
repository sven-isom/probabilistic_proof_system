**Definition 6.2** (the class $\mathcal{BPP}$): *A [[Decision Problem|decision problem]] $S$ is in $\mathcal{BPP}$ if there exists a probabilistic polynomial-time algorithm $A$ such that for every $x \in S$ it holds that $\Pr[A(x) = 1] \geq 2/3$ and for every $x \notin S$ it holds that $\Pr[A(x) = 0] \geq 2/3$.*
