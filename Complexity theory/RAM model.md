## 1 Definition

RAM (Random Access Memory) is a type of computer memory with the following definition and characteristics:

1. **Random Access**: RAM allows data to be accessed in any order, with equal read and write speeds, regardless of the physical location of the data.
2. **Temporary Storage**: RAM is volatile memory, meaning that data stored in RAM is lost when the power is turned off.
3. **Fast Read/Write**: RAM provides faster data access speeds compared to other storage devices (like hard drives or SSDs), making it suitable for temporarily storing running programs and data.
4. **Types**: There are mainly two types of RAM:
   - **DRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory)**: Requires periodic refreshing to maintain data, commonly used for main memory.
   - **SRAM (Static Random Access Memory)**: Does not require refreshing, is faster but more expensive, and is typically used for cache.

> RAM supports the quick operation of operating systems and applications.
